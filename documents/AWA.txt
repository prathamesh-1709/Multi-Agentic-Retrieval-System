Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Clients will often use this in combination with autoscaling (a process that allows a client to use more computing in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computing web services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IoT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS server farms. This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. One of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console. AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk (HDD)/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).

AWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a "Pay-as-you-go" model), hardware, operating system, software, and networking features chosen by the subscriber requiring various degrees of availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either.[7] Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g. physical security of the data centers) while other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g. account management, vulnerability scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions including seven in North America.[8]

Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large-scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[9] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways. As of 2023 Q1, AWS has 31% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 25%, and 11% respectively, according to Synergy Research Group.[10][11]

Services
Main articles: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Amazon S3
As of 2021, AWS comprises over 200[12] products and services including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, machine learning,[13] mobile, developer tools, RobOps and tools for the Internet of Things. The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Connect, and AWS Lambda (a serverless function that can perform arbitrary code written in any language that can be configured to be triggered by hundreds of events, including HTTP calls).[14]

Services expose functionality through APIs for clients to use in their applications. These APIs are accessed over HTTP, using the REST architectural style and SOAP protocol for older APIs and exclusively JSON for newer ones. Clients can interact with these APIs in various ways, including from the AWS console (a website), by using SDKs written in various languages (such as Python, Java, and JavaScript), or by making direct REST calls.

Founding (2000â€“2005)

The genesis of AWS came in the early 2000s. After building Merchant.com, Amazon's e-commerce-as-a-service platform that offers third-party retailers a way to build their own web-stores, Amazon pursued service-oriented architecture as a means to scale its engineering operations,[15][16][17][18][19][20][21] led by then CTO Allan Vermeulen.[22]

Around the same time frame, Amazon was frustrated with the speed of its software engineering, and sought to implement various recommendations put forth by Matt Round, an engineering leader at the time, including maximization of autonomy for engineering teams, adoption of REST, standardization of infrastructure, removal of gate-keeping decision-makers (bureaucracy), and continuous deployment. He also called for increasing the percentage of the time engineers spent building the software rather than doing other tasks.[23] Amazon created "a shared IT platform" so its engineering organizations, which were spending 70% of their time on "undifferentiated heavy-lifting" such as IT and infrastructure problems, could focus on customer-facing innovation instead.[24][25] Besides, in dealing with unusual peak traffic patterns, especially during the holiday season, by migrating services to commodity Linux hardware and relying on open source software, Amazon's Infrastructure team, led by Tom Killalea,[26] Amazon's first CISO,[27] had already run its data centers and associated services in a "fast, reliable, cheap" way.[26]

In July 2002 Amazon.com Web Services, managed by Colin Bryar,[28] launched its first web services, opening up the Amazon.com platform to all developers.[29] Over one hundred applications were built on top of it by 2004.[30] This unexpected developer interest took Amazon by surprise and convinced them that developers were "hungry for more".[25]

By the summer of 2003, Andy Jassy had taken over Bryar's portfolio[31] at Rick Dalzell's behest, after Vermeulen, who was Bezos' first pick, declined the offer.[22] Jassy subsequently mapped out the vision for an "Internet OS"[15][17][19][32] made up of foundational infrastructure primitives that alleviated key impediments to shipping software applications faster.[15][16][17][19][21] By fall 2003,[15][17] databases, storage, and compute were identified as the first set of infrastructure pieces that Amazon should launch.[15][17][25]

Jeff Barr, an early AWS employee, credits Vermeulen, Jassy, Bezos himself, and a few others for coming up with the idea that would evolve into EC2, S3, and RDS;[33] Jassy recalls the idea was the result of brainstorming for about a week with "ten of the best technology minds and ten of the best product management minds" on about ten different internet applications and the most primitive building blocks required to build them.[19] Werner Vogels cites Amazon's desire to make the process of "invent, launch, reinvent, relaunch, start over, rinse, repeat" as fast as it could was leading them to break down organizational structures with "two-pizza teams"[c] and application structures with distributed systems;[d] and that these changes ultimately paved way for the formation of AWS[21] and its mission "to expose all of the atomic-level pieces of the Amazon.com platform".[36] According to Brewster Kahle, co-founder of Alexa Internet, which was acquired by Amazon in 1999, his start-up's compute infrastructure helped Amazon solve its big data problems and later informed the innovations that underpinned AWS.[37]

Jassy assembled a founding team of 57 employees from a mix of engineering and business backgrounds to kick-start these initiatives,[19][18] with a majority of the hires coming from outside the company;[19] Jeff Lawson, Twilio CEO,[38] Adam Selipsky, Tableau CEO,[39][40] and Mikhail Seregine,[41] co-founder at Outschool among them.

In late 2003, the concept for compute,[e] which would later launch as EC2, was reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper internally describing a vision for Amazon's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway. Near the end of their paper, they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service, proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment.[43][unreliable source?] Thereafter Pinkham, Willem van Biljon, and lead developer Christopher Brown developed the Amazon EC2 service, with a team in Cape Town, South Africa.[44]
